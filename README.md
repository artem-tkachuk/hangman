Accidentally found this really old code I wrote ages ago for implementing the hangman game with terminal-based UI. I am just going to keep it on GitHub as a part of my path to becoming a developer! Who knows, one day I will probably do a huge refactoring of this code and add a better UI! XD 

Please, download (.rar)[https://github.com/artem-tkachuk/hangman/blob/master/Gibbet.rar] file and unzip it to be able to play!
